- 1Co 12
- gift of companionship

Welcome to God's family {
  - Our love for each other should be the demonstration to the world of 
      - the power of Jesus' love
      - and the relational transformation that happens in and among us when we follow Him 
        (Jn 13:34-35)
  - This love springs from the love that the Father and the Son enjoy, 
    a love in which the entire church gets to share.
    How abundantly gracious of Jesus to "give" us "the glory" the Father gave Him
    (Jn 17:@2)

 - relish in the fact that GOd has formed a family in and around Jesus
    - Yes we make a personal decision to follow Jesus, but we follow Him in chorus, not solo.
    - When we are born into Christ, we join a family that shares in God's blessings
    ACTS 2:40-47
      - over 3k new family members became part of God's family, the church.
      - They took care of each other's
        - needs
        - sharing everything in common

  - Bible is replete with scriptures about the body of Christ {
    - Eph 4:1-16
    - Col 1:15-20
    - Eph 1:22-23
    - Ro 12:3-8
    - 1Co 12:12-27

    - All these scriptures teaches us that EVERY person is needed and we are part of each other, honoring one another, and building each other.
      We help each other grow up into Christ
      We are taught many ways to be with one another as we strengthen and equip each other to walk our paths individually and collectively.
    - Deitrich Bonhoeffer's question on felllowship {
        - Has the fellowship served to make the individual free, strong, and mature?
          OR has it made him weak and dependent?
        - Has it taken him by the hand for a while in order that he may learn to walk by himself?
          OR has it made him uneasy and unsure?
        - God intends that ww help each other grow up into him so that we can walk the path of our Christian journey.
      }
    Our camaraderie is meant ot STRENGTHEN US along the way.
  }

  COMMUNITY AND VULNERABILITY {
    - WE will not be able to feel or express the need for others if we are not first able 
        - to behold God, 
        - understand our identity from God's perspective, 
        - learn to be vulnerable,
        - and depened on His completely fatihful and life-giving SPirit.
  
    - Jesus in his humanity understood vulnerability as he continually gave His heart to people, even those who hurt or neglected Him in His hour of need.

    Mt 26:36-40 {
      - JEsu taught His disciples the need for vulnerability and trust.
      - then on the cross, HE taught His most poignant lesson.
      - Looking at those who mocked, tortured, and betrayed Him, he found the words to say:
        "Father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing" (Lk 23:@4)
        - This requires a level of humility and vulnerability beyong imagination.
    }

    Vulnerability can be difficult if we have been hurt in the past and we can resist opening up our hearts {
      - Frederick Buechner speaks of the importance of recognizing our resistance to vulnerability as he pen...
        - When we are not vulnerable, we miss out on relational intimacy and transformation that comes from those relationships.
      - People hurt us, friends, colleagues, school friends, neighbors, family members, and our church family hurt us.
        Likewise, we have hurt others.
      - While not the topic of this section, forgiveness is crucial to understand and practice in relationships.
        Forgivenes DOES NOT MEAN we don't address the hurt from bitterness.
        Without forgiveness, there is no possibility for a new beginning.
      - Jesus shows us how, setting the example for us

    - We often see ourselves thru ways others see us.
    ** THis is why it is so important to realize how Jesus sees us and our neighbors ** {
        - after Jesus was resurrected, HE entrusted His message and ministry to men and women, to many whome had denied Him.
          THis is a vulnerable trust and can only come from a humble servant who knows who He is, where He came from, and where He is going
          (Jn 8:14)
        - HUMILITY is necessary for building relationships with others, and to understand this more fully,
          the beautiful Hymn, in Php 2 describes this HUmility:
      }
    }

    (Php 2:1-11) Read and reflect { 
      Ways that humility might help you become more vulnerable and allow you to build deeper relationships.
      Pray for God to reveal to you ways you can practice greater unity and humility.
    }
  }

  Jesus teaches us in community {
    - Jesus was the master of building community
      HE KNEW the only way the world would see the Kingdom of Heaven on earth was thru the disciple's love for each other (Jn 13:35)
        - He gathered a diverse group to accompny Him, so they could learn together from Him and each other.
    - as we read the Gospels, we learn
      - to value how the unique background and personality of each disciple placed them in a position to learn from one another.
      - Like wise, listening to and surrounding ourselves with people who aren't just like us helps us to grow deeper in loving relationships.
    - JEsus employed the practice of community discussion, somewthing we are attmepting to practice, throughout our "Path" journey.

    - Throughout the GOsepls, JEsus teaches His disicples in community {
      *** He often uses the situations in front of them to communicate something important.***
      For example: Matthew 15 and 16
      - Jesus and disciples directly engage with the PHarisees regarding what defiles someone.
      - they also face a deeply challenging trial involving the hunger of thousands of people 
        and must consider how to satisfy this group by putting their Faith in their Provider.
      BOTH along the way,
      - JEsus tells them to LISTEN and UNDERSTAND.
        and then opens it into a discussion during which questions are asked and addressed in a "group teach"
      - Jesus asks rhetorical questions that come up again later that undoubtedly helped them to remember!
    }

    - Also read when JEsus takes twelve aside to teach them what would soon happen to Him (Mt 20) {
      - Jesus calls group together and taught them about the first becoming last (v16)
      - Woman annointing JEsus at Bethany (Mt 26:8) about the heart of gratitude and love.
    }
  }

  Reflection {
    - Consider a time when you have learned something important because of being in a group.
      How did the group process help you learn?
      In what ways did the group learning process contribute to camaraderie?

    - Do you agree that spiritual transformation is incomplete when we don't learn in community?
      If so, why? If not, why not?

    - If you are an introvert by nature, 
      how might you incorporate group discussions in ways that can enhance your learning and teaching?

    - How can you initiate more ways to practice spiritual growth in the community?

The COmmunity of Us {
  The Community of Us is a community of Freedom {
    - Western Culture's perspective emphasizes the indivudal's freedom, tastes, lifestyle, and choices.
      BUT the Bible embraces a COMMUNAL WAY OF LIFE.
    - In our culture, it is very hard to understand how being an "us" is more freeing than being an "I".
      In Southern Africa this communal interconnected way of life is known as "Ubuntu Principle"
      MLK Jr described this reality thru words taken from his 1965 commencement speech at Oberlin College
        - Life is interrelated, and we are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.
        - Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.
        - can never be what you ought to be until I am what I ought to be
          this is the interrelated structure of reality"
    - Research
      - supports the ways in which connection to something bigger than ourselves binds us together for a communal purpose
        AND has also shown that it spurs those who see beyong their own situation to act more compassionately and generously toward others.
    - Imagine a journey where group faces tough terrain
        - someone may want to go ahead and not help or carry buderns of group together
        - This is one of the biggest challenges to a relationship-oriented way of life.
          We are likely familiar with the frustrations that can plant themselves in our hearts and lead to complaints
          such as "if they only walked at my pace" or "they don't know this trail like I do"
        - THese feelings may express a desire for freedom
          BUT they do not reflect the freedom of the Spirit (2Co 3:17)
          or the "one-another" life mentioned so often in the Scriptures (59X in fact, as a command about how to treat others)

    - The community of "Us in Christ" frees us from
        - selfishness
        - isolation
        - and self-deception
        - and frees us for love
    - The way we journey on our path, not only affects us, but as we are part of God's family, our jounrey also impacts others
      When we have not "beheld" God or "experienced" deep love with God,
      - we will most likely seek to fulfill certain expectations from our family members,
        rather than GIVE TO THEM out of the fullness of our hearts.
      - Then their reactions to our reactions tangle the web of unfulfilled longing, diminishing our freedom.
    - When we BEHOLD God on our journey, other's reactions become less important.
      Then we can, like Jesus, freely respond with love.
  }

  The Community of Us shares Burdens {
  - we are not meant to carry our burdens or griefs alone
    Our families can be sharers or victims of our grief
  - in a family, physical or spiritual, our paths often collide, and to avoid collisions on our paht
    we need to TAKE TIME to sort out the baggage accompanying our difficulties along the path and learn to listen to ways others are responding to theirs.

  - When we do collide with others
      TAKE THE NEEDED TIME to LISTEN to each other and find resolutions.
      BE VULNERABLE in expressing grief
      PRAY with each other and OFFER HOPE

  - Our goal as we grow together and bear one another's burdens in community is
    - to help each other become whole, mature, and complete in Christ.
    - As Paul says with stirring conviction:
        He is the one we proclaim,
        admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom,
        so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ
        (Col 1:28)
  - As we journey thru our paths, let us help each other toward this goal.

Finding and SHaring Our Gifts {
  - How sad, difficult, and boring would life be if we all had one gift
    we could not accomplish much.
  - HOW AMAZING that God put us together in a way that allows each of us to contribute.
    The desire to contribute and to be needed is a deep longing within us.
  - Scripture teaches us that we all have something to bring to the community,
    and one gift is not more important than another.

  Rom 12:3-8
  1Co 12:12-37
  1Pe 4:10-11
  {
    - we often see gifts in others but not ourselves.
    - we can place more value on others' gifts than ones we may have been given.
    Peter brings together all key ingredients in an uplifting way in 1Pe 4:10
    - each gift received to serve others
    - fatihful stewrds of GOd's grace in its various forms
      We were each born with specific gifts from God that neither came from us nor are aimed only to edify us.
      We carry God's transformative grace.
      God is sharing His grace thru us! Thats stunning
      Not only has God's love been "poured into our hearts" (Ro 5:5)
      but we are also a channel thru which God's grace is shared.
  }

  What are our gifts {
    - "gifts" referred to in 1Co 12, Ro 12, EPh 4, and 1Pe 4 come from the Greek word "charisma" {
        - divine gratuity
        - a spiritual endowment
        - a free gift
      }
    - We CAN'T earn them, we DON'T deserve them, but we are TO USE them.
  }

  Key Differences b/w gifts listed in Eph 4 and 1Co 12 {
    - Manifestations of 1Co 12 {
      - The 9 gifts listed are associated with the word "phanerosis"
      - these are supernatural manifestations of the SPirit at work thru a believer.
      - NOT the same as 1Pe, NOT possession of the person
    }
    - Ministry gifts of Eph 4 {
      - These gifts are doma, like a gift given to us
      - Jesus ascencion presented gifts of people who were called and gifted 
        to lead and train the rest of the body of Christ

      - 5 Ministry Gifts (not titles but functions) {
        - The apostle = one who establishes and stengthens churches
        - The prophet = one who speaks forth the message of God
        - The evangelist = one who is called to preach the Gospel
        - The pastor = one who feeds and shepherds the believers
        - The teacher = one who instructs believers in the Word of God
      }
      - THese can be called EQUIPPING GIFTS, 
        enabling believers to do the work of the ministry 
        so that the church can function as Christ's representative.
      - 1Co 12:28-30 is a conglomeration of the 3 different categories of gifts
    }
  }
  The gifts discussed in our Path convos concerns the MOTIVATIONAL GIFTS described by Paul in Ro 12

  Romans 12:6-8 {
    - The word gifts in Romans, "charismate", is the same word (but in singular form) in 1Pe 4:10.
    - Tbe gifts discussed in Ro 12 are likely gifts Peter was referring to.
    These are gifts we possess, which God has built into us 
    to be part of us, 
    and to be used for the benefit of others 
    and for His glory.
    - We don't deserve them but God gave them to us.
    - Referred to as motivational gifts, since they provide motivating force for our lives.
      They help shape our personalities.
    Many tools now to figure out these gifts, understand them, and how to use them for the sake of others.
    As we grow and become more like Jesus, Paul's words in 2Co 12:9-10 give us reason to rejoice. 
    - as we give our hearts to each other and love each other thru the use of our gifts,
      the image of Christ brightly shines thru us.

Trail Guides: SPiritual Rhythms for the sake of the world {
  - God not only wants us to walk our path with confidence and joy alongside others who have embraced this way,
    He also calls us to be Trail Guides for others.
  - Trail Guides don't have to be experts,
    they simply have been walking that trail with Christ longer than those that follow or who have never begun.
  - God is seeking to bring all of His children home.
    We are also blessed to be able to be a trail guide for those that are just beginning their journey.
    By guiding others we deepen our knowledge of the path and the ultimate trail guide, Jesus Christ.

  - Sharing our faith is one of several spiritual practices that teach us many new things.
    you learn more from those you guide than what they learn from you.
  - one could say that the Israelites lost their faith because they werent sharing it, when they stopped guiding they stopped rememberinf and many of them unfortunaely left the path
    That is why this new covenant is so special
    WE GET TO share the path with anyone from the nations that desire life to the full.

  From the overflow {
    - God reminds us to allow the necesaary space in our hearts and minfs for God's SPirit to refresh our souls
  }

  Habits that Keep Us In Tune with the SPirit {
    - WE will not go off trail because we cling to the promuses of God and our deicsion to walk with Him.
    1) Weekly Resistance - Fast from something for 24hrs
    2_ Daily EMbrace - Meal or call to encourage somebody each day
    3) Daily Resistance - Read Scripture before using the phone
    4) Weekly Embrace - Sabbath (for a large portion of day) of prayer, reflection, and rejoicing completely centered on God

    - Each of us can explote what ocmbination of habits fit our current season and stage of life
