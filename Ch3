RENEW

Intro {
  - paths can get complicated; hardships etc. 
  - Life is not a linear path; there are ups and downs
  - 1/3 of Psalms expresses deep sorrow, grief, regret, loneliness, and regret.{
    - Express intense emotions, real human struggles, and the anguish experienced by the people of Israel as they lived out their faith individually and corporately
    - poetry and hymns touch our souls more than the narrative.
  }
  Ps 22:2-6 (MSG version but here is NIV) {
    2 My God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer,
      by night, but I find no rest.
    3 Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One;
      you are the one Israel praises.
    4 In you our ancestors put their trust;
      they trusted and you delivered them.
    5 To you they cried out and were saved;
      in you they trusted and were not put to shame.
    
  6 But I am a worm and not a man,
      scorned by everyone, despised by the people.
  }
}

Resilent Faith {
  - We shouldn;t be surprised at hardships, afterall, Jesus taught us:
    - We would have toruble in this world (Jn 16:33)
    - Each day has enough trouble of its own (Mt 6:34)
    - Take heart, I have overcome the world

  - However, it's easier to read than to walk faithfully through the troubles.
  - David in the psalms vulnerably gives language to the emotions we often carry.
  ** When we don't address our torubles, we will find it difficult to overcome them**

  Vulnerability and Songs of Lament {
  - David teaches us {
    - how to be honest, and how to lament.
    - the value of vulnerability through expressing pain
    - also the importance of emotional expressions such as those elicited through music and poetry.
    }
  - The psalms teaches us ways to express pain throguh aveneus that words alone can't express, reaching into our core "feeling channels" of our hearts.
  - God created harmony, displayed thorughout His creation, it's music, art, and poetry that often helps us lament, find comfort, and bring us to joy.

  - movement of life's challenges {
    - through seasons of orientation, when things are stable, to disorientation, when life falls apart or changes
    - and then on to reorientation, where we can once again find peace.

    - This cycle of orientation, disorientation, and reorientation can serve as a helpful tool in our growth, 
      and we can trace the psalms through each of these stages, except a few such as Ps 88
      - Ps 88, writer does not yet reach reorientation and is "just being real" in despair.
      ** Sometimes we just get stuck, and our journey takes a bit longer than we wish **
    }
  }

  Job Gets Real {
    - Job is attacked by the evil one, suffering intensely {
      - his whole world falls apart in a matter of days.
      - Job was a man of integrity, who knew God and whom God knew. They TRUSTED each other.
      - Job's responses can teach us to be honest with God. Gut-level honesty {
        - he did not held back expressing to God and his friends how he felt
        - while at the same time, he realized God was God, and he was not.
        - he also had a keen sense of his identity, in that {
          - he held to his convictions
          - and never lost his integrity.
          }
        - he had quetions for God that God did not answer.
        }
      }
    - Job 10:1-10 {
      - THis is a snapshot of lament.
      - Job holds to his integrity even tho he loathes the day he was born
      - he also tells God that God doesn't understand him, because God is not human.
      }
    - God later did become flesh and dwelt among us in the form of Jesus.
    - Jesus gets us because He experienced all human emotions and was acquainted with grief
    - He can understand us and accompany us thru the healing process
    - He knows we also need other people to come alongside us, as we were made for relational connection.
      - If we dont vulnerably address our broken places honestly and healthfully,
        we will get tangled and stuck in negative emotions and false identities.
    - JEsus was vulnerable yet confident of who He was, and so can we be,
      if we understand:
        - whhere we come from
        - where we are going
        - and that we are God's beloved.

    - We attribute such pain to our fallen world and death as a result
    - however death is also a portion of God's grace to carry us beyond this broken, hate-filled, sin-filled, fear-filled, broken world.
    - ONly Jesus can fix this by defeating death and allowing us to be imperishable as we pass through death (1Co 15:50-52)

  - Job did this out loud for all us to know
  - he sets an example of an honest relationship with God.
    ** Relationships require honesty and vulnerability **
    - yet we can become expert "stuffers" before God, what kind of relationship withholds vulnerability??
  }

  Putting Our Lament into Words {
  - Putting our lament, may even our hirt toward God, helps us get in touch with what is really going on in our hearts.
  - Hard because ti may feel weak and vulnerable and tempts us to ffeel we should be stronger

  - Can you name your emotions to God, or do you tend to deal with him concerning facts?
  - try naming your fear, insecurity, loneliness, anger, and hurt.
    only then will you also be able to name your joy, comfort, security, gratitude, laughter, and healing.

  - Lament and grieving is part of God's plan, it is necessary
  - as God's image bearers, we are meant to grieve.
    - Jesus wept. He mourned, he grieved.
    - In bible, grieving was accompanied by visceral activities such as  {
      - Fasting
      - Tearing clothes
      - Wearing ashes
      - Singing songs of mourning
      - Crying loudly
      }
  - Mourners find rest for their souls by turning to God and deepening their faith.
  ** The psalms of despair have silver lining, but we need to rmemeber that God will hold us tightly **

  Ps 73:23-26
    - Faith building and comforting
    - but previous show the heart struggle to reach this place of trust
  Ps 73:2-5, 13-17A
    - Keep going until you enter the sanctuary of God. THis is not a church auditorium, but the safe, strong hand of God
  }

  God sees us and provides for us in the wilderness {
    - Hagar example, wandering in desser until God saw her
    Ge 16:13
      - vulnerably laments her abondonment
      - GOd helps her gain reorientation as once again she sees the God who sees her.
      - God is always listening and cares, always. and keeps His promises.
  
    - Transformation takes place when we believe that God sees, hears, and cares
      even when His answers are not as we wish {
        - When our eyes are open to see what God provides for us no matter how painful the situation.
        - He always provides thru His Spirit 
        - when we open our eyes to see God (EPH 1:17) we find the well of living water that God has so graciously provided.
            17 I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father,
            may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better.
        - We must TRUST His love.
      }
  }

  Steadfast and Ready Amid Challenges {
    - Other men and women of God, most of them, spent time in the desert. {
      - Adam and Eve left the garden
      - Abram wandered in the desert
      - MOses wandered in the wilderness
      - Naomi wandered back to her homeland
      - JEsus went to the wilderness after HIs baptism and before beginning His ministry
      - Paul spent 3 years in the desert after his conversion and before beginning his ministry to the Gentiles.
    }
    - Why desert?
      - allowed them to wrestle with who they were and who God is, readying them for the next steps on their path
      - (like Paul) learned to persevere and find wholeness in Christ in all kinds of settings across the Roman Empire.
  
    - meditate and pray on these verses {
      - 2Co 4:8-9
      Prayer: My Father, I felt afflicted when ___, but i was not crushed. 
      - Php 2:13
      Prayer: My Father, I thank you that I am not alone and that you are at work with me and in me. May I embrace this incredible truth when I ___
      - Php 4:10-13
      Prayer: Generous God, I am least content when _____. Teach me true contentment from the inside. I will entrust myself to you in the most trying of situations so that I can see how you supply peace and mercy and glorify you.
    }
  }

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 What do we need to forge ahead? {
  Identify your non-negotiables {
    - one thing to remain steadfast on the path and another to become stronger as we walk it.
    - God sees, hears, sustains, and also builds our resilence and stability for the long haul.
      - we know we will be tested, but with God, we can even welcome the tests (Jas 1:2-3)
        and gain greater clarity as we go through them.
          2 Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters,
            whenever you face trials of many kinds,
          3 because you know that the testing of your faith 
            produces perseverance.
    - Depending on our season of life {
        - we may find that we need to strengthen convictions we originally formed many years ago
        - or form new convictions to meet a new challenge that once was not so demanding.
      }

    ** These convictions are non-negotiables ** {
      - the core convictions, values, and practices necessary to remain on the path with Christ
      - despite the appeal of detours, smoother paths, or flatter surfaces that require less effort.
      - We can also call these the "anchors" that keep us solidly standing in awe of God.
      }

  - Lk 4:1 {
    - Jesus sent into the desert by Spirit for a clear purpose:
      - to establish certain "non-negotiables" 
      - or essential convictions regarding how he would live His life and mission.

      - Challenges are different versions of the same ones we face (read gospels and Heb 4:15)
          15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, 
              but we have one who has been tempted in every way, 
              just as we are—
              yet he did not sin.
      }

  - Lk 4:1-5 {
    - Shows us the wonderful fruit formed when holding scripture so deeply into our hearts and minds that 
        * it shapes our reflexes, 
        * our most deeply held assumptions, 
        * and our most basic thoughts about life.
    - He would not negotiate with satan about the basics and neither should we
    - He showed us how we can resist the tests and remain anchored to GOd's will.
    }

  - This is where the truths we have been learning and practicing come to our aid. {
    - They center us by helping us seek the God who seeks us, speaks to us, bolsters us, and keeps His promises.
    }

   ** Our non-negotiables, our core convictions and practices rooted in audacious and trusting faith, will determine our lifelong followership **
  - These keep us attuned to God's voice and aligned with His power, not our own.
  }

  Embrace God's work to make you whole {
    - God seeks to renew us inwardly 
        - day-by-day (2Co 4:16)
        - with ever increasing glory (2Co 3:18)
    - God renews us as we continue along on our quest, 
      not just at the beginning and the end of the path.
    - HE transforms us to fully and beautifully reflect His image as we walk along the path.
        Each time we take new steps on this path we can become more whole in Christ,
        learning to love as He loves.
    - "mature" in NT {
        - teleios
        - also means "complete" or "whole"
      } 
    - The process of being conformed to the likeness of the Son of God is a process toward greater wholeness in God.
      - God takes what is fragmenetd, partial, or disintegrated, and brings it together into a mosaic of divine artistry.
    
    Kintsugi bowl {
      - Japanese art involving taking broken pieces of a vessel and putting them back together using gold
        thus making a vessel look different but more beautiful and valuable than it ever was before.
      - picture gathering the broken pieces, representing experiences of your life, 
        the parts of the path on your journey that caused pain to the point you wanted to quit
        maybe in the form of loss, rejection, disappointment, abuse, addiction, loneliness, or physical, mental, or emotional challneges
        Broken pieces waiting to be transformed.
        Then imagine the original potter, designer, or creator coming alongside you
        you hand the designer the broken pieces and He helps you put it back together, using precious gold.
        though the vessel is not exactly the same as it once was, you marvel at its beauty
        and that this exquisite creation was made from your broken pieces
    }
    - God thru Jesus and power of SPirit, c an turn our weakness into strengths
      and thru cracks now filled with gold, let the light of Christ shine thru us.
  }

  Join God's Dreams {
    - Along with this faith, walking forward on the path involves
      letting God's dreams become ours, partnering with God, rather than asking God to bless my plans.
    - Motivation built on GOd's dreams becoming ours is so much deeper and sustainable than asking God to join ours.
    How does He desire for us to join Him in His mission in the world? {
      - Acts 2:17 {
          - God initiates a new chapter towards the fulfillment of the vision of salvation and transformation which prophets spoke about
          - Peter recounts Joel's words
          - Spirit-inspired dreams come in various forms for men and women of all ages.
            tho not a blueprint of what will take place, they do include:
            * definite attitudes, convictions, and rhythms that will mark your life *
        }
      }
    - There is a certain level of uncertainty built into the entire adventure
      However, this uncertainty does not nullify a vision of who you are and will be while walking along with Christ.
    - Even if you are familiar with the contours of a trail, that does not mean you know all of what you will encounter.
      * Morever, SPirit inspired dream of who you will be and how you will serve on this path,
        how you will respond to adversity,
        and how you will view others and give of yourself to them in order to fulfill God's good purpose
        is meant to be a source of overwhelming joy.
  } 
}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Reflection {
  - Open the scriptures and open all of your mind, heart, soul, and strength.
    listening to what God's Spirit inspires within you.
  - Prayerfully consider your family, small group, ministry, workplace, neighborhood, and city.
    Ask God to help you see each one through His eyes.
  
  - What dreams are awakened or stirred regarding these relationships and places?
  - Who will you be (or become) in these relationships and places?

  - After, pause and pray over this Q:
    If you wake up tomorrow and live life to the full in JEsus, what would that look like?
  - Then jot down the significant ideas and images of inspiration that came to you.

      - living fearlessly, encouraged and filled with God's love
      - sharing the good news, being that light thru my actions/attitude/behavior
      - being more loving and caring and compassionate of others
      - more curious about everyone and their lives
      - finding God thru each one of them and their situations.
}

BEfore concluding:
- pause and look at the notes you wrote down 
- take an extra step and write a response to this Q:
  What dreams are you willing to actively pursue?
  - ???

  Mt 17:20 "just a mustard seed of faith" is required to walk toward fulfilliment of a God-inspired purpose
  - us statrting this work and not just waiting for the perfect opportunity God will work thru us.
  - and our faithfulness will grow and we willl be energized from within to continue to clear away all the debris and set our gaze on the pioneer of our faith.
  JESUS
  - thankful that our long term integrity in pursuing a Spirit inspired vision is something we can pursue with confidence
  - as Paul prayed: 1Th 5:23b-24
    23 May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. 
      May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
    24 The one who calls you is faithful, 
      and he will do it.
