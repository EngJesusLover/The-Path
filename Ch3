RENEW

Intro {
  - paths can get complicated; hardships etc. 
  - Life is not a linear path; there are ups and downs
  - 1/3 of Psalms expresses deep sorrow, grief, regret, loneliness, and regret.{
    - Express intense emotions, real human struggles, and the anguish experienced by the people of Israel as they lived out their faith individually and corporately
    - poetry and hymns touch our souls more than the narrative.
  }
  Ps 22:2-6 (MSG version but here is NIV) {
    2 My God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer,
      by night, but I find no rest.
    3 Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One;
      you are the one Israel praises.
    4 In you our ancestors put their trust;
      they trusted and you delivered them.
    5 To you they cried out and were saved;
      in you they trusted and were not put to shame.
    
  6 But I am a worm and not a man,
      scorned by everyone, despised by the people.

Resilent Faith {
  - We shouldn;t be surprised at hardships, afterall, Jesus taught us:
    - We would have toruble in this world (Jn 16:33)
    - Each day has enough trouble of its own (Mt 6:34)
    - Take heart, I have overcome the world

  - However, it's easier to read than to walk faithfully through the troubles.
  - David in the psalms vulnerably gives language to the emotions we often carry.
  ** When we don't address our torubles, we will find it difficult to overcome them**

  Vulnerability and Songs of Lament {
  - David teaches us {
    - how to be honest, and how to lament.
    - the value of vulnerability through expressing pain
    - also the importance of emotional expressions such as those elicited through music and poetry.
    }
  - The psalms teaches us ways to express pain throguh aveneus that words alone can't express, reaching into our core "feeling channels" of our hearts.
  - God created harmony, displayed thorughout His creation, it's music, art, and poetry that often helps us lament, find comfort, and bring us to joy.

  - movement of life's challenges {
    - through seasons of orientation, when things are stable, to disorientation, when life falls apart or changes
    - and then on to reorientation, where we can once again find peace.

    - This cycle of orientation, disorientation, and reorientation can serve as a helpful tool in our growth, 
      and we can trace the psalms through each of these stages, except a few such as Ps 88
      - Ps 88, writer does not yet reach reorientation and is "just being real" in despair.
      ** Sometimes we just get stuck, and our journey takes a bit longer than we wish **
    }

  Job Gets Real {
    - Job is attacked by the evil one, suffering intensely {
      - his whole world falls apart in a matter of days.
      - Job was a man of integrity, who knew God and whom God knew. They TRUSTED each other.
      - Job's responses can teach us to be honest with God. Gut-level honesty {
        - he did not held back expressing to God and his friends how he felt
        - while at the same time, he realized God was God, and he was not.
        - he also had a keen sense of his identity, in that {
          - he held to his convictions
          - and never lost his integrity.
          }
        - he had quetions for God that God did not answer.
        }
      }
    - Job 10:1-10 {
      - THis is a snapshot of lament.
      - Job holds to his integrity even tho he loathes the day he was born
      - he also tells God that God doesn't understand him, because God is not human.
      }
    - God later did become flesh and dwelt among us in the form of Jesus.
    - Jesus gets us because He experienced all human emotions and was acquainted with grief
    - He can understand us and accompany us thru the healing process
    - He knows we also need other people to come alongside us, as we were made for relational connection.
      - If we dont vulnerably address our broken places honestly and healthfully,
        we will get tangled and stuck in negative emotions and false identities.
    - JEsus was vulnerable yet confident of who He was, and so can we be,
      if we understand:
        - whhere we come from
        - where we are going
        - and that we are God's beloved.

    - We attribute such pain to our fallen world and death as a result
    - however death is also a portion of God's grace to carry us beyond this broken, hate-filled, sin-filled, fear-filled, broken world.
    - ONly Jesus can fix this by defeating death and allowing us to be imperishable as we pass through death (1Co 15:50-52)

  - Job did this out loud for all us to know
  - he sets an example of an honest relationship with God.
    ** Relationships require honesty and vulnerability **
    - yet we can become expert "stuffers" before God, what kind of relationship withholds vulnerability??

  Putting Our Lament into Words {
  - Putting our lament, may even our hirt toward God, helps us get in touch with what is really going on in our hearts.
  - Hard because ti may feel weak and vulnerable and tempts us to ffeel we should be stronger

  - Can you name your emotions to God, or do you tend to deal with him concerning facts?
  - try naming your fear, insecurity, loneliness, anger, and hurt.
    only then will you also be able to name your joy, comfort, security, gratitude, laughter, and healing.

  - Lament and grieving is part of God's plan, it is necessary
  - as God's image bearers, we are meant to grieve.
    - Jesus wept. He mourned, he grieved.
    - In bible, grieving was accompanied by visceral activities such as  {
      - Fasting
      - Tearing clothes
      - Wearing ashes
      - Singing songs of mourning
      - Crying loudly
      }
  - Mourners find rest for their souls by turning to God and deepening their faith.
  ** The psalms of despair have silver lining, but we need to rmemeber that God will hold us tightly **

  Ps 73:23-26
    - Faith building and comforting
    - but previous show the heart struggle to reach this place of trust
  Ps 73:2-5, 13-17A
    - Keep going until you enter the sanctuary of God. THis is not a church auditorium, but the safe, strong hand of God

  God sees us and provides for us in the wilderness {
    - Hagar example, wandering in desser until God saw her
    Ge 16:13
      - vulnerably laments her abondonment
      - GOd helps her gain reorientation as once again she sees the God who sees her.
      - God is always listening and cares, always. and keeps His promises.
  
    - Transformation takes place when we believe that God sees, hears, and cares
      even when His answers are not as we wish {
        - When our eyes are open to see what God provides for us no matter how painful the situation.
        - He always provides thru His Spirit 
        - when we open our eyes to see God (EPH 1:17) we find the well of living water that God has so graciously provided.
            17 I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father,
            may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better.
        - We must TRUST His love.

  Steadfast and Ready Amid Challenges {
    - Other men and women of God, most of them, spent time in the desert. {
      - Adam and Eve left the garden
      - Abram wandered in the desert
      - MOses wandered in the wilderness
      - Naomi wandered back to her homeland
      - JEsus went to the wilderness after HIs baptism and before beginning His ministry
      - Paul spent 3 years in the desert after his conversion and before beginning his ministry to the Gentiles.
    }
    - Why desert?
      - allowed them to wrestle with who they were and who God is, readying them for the next steps on their path
      - (like Paul) learned to persevere and find wholeness in Christ in all kinds of settings across the Roman Empire.
  
    - meditate and pray on these verses {
      - 2Co 4:8-9
      Prayer: My Father, I felt afflicted when ___, but i was not crushed. 
      - Php 2:13
      Prayer: My Father, I thank you that I am not alone and that you are at work with me and in me. May I embrace this incredible truth when I ___
      - Php 4:10-13
      Prayer: Generous God, I am least content when _____. Teach me true contentment from the inside. I will entrust myself to you in the most trying of situations so that I can see how you supply peace and mercy and glorify you.
